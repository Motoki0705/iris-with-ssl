# F-04 Results â€” Baseline Smoke Test Suite

## Overview

- Added shared pytest fixtures for dataset access and ticket-scoped artefact directories.
- Authored smoke tests for datasets, metrics, and visualization helpers in `ml.core`.
- Ensured figures produced during tests are stored under `docs/results/tmp/F-04/` and cleaned after execution.

## Current Coverage

- Dataset utilities: verifies Iris/Auto MPG loaders return populated frames and `train_test_split_frame` retains sample counts.
- Metric evaluators: checks `ClassificationReport` and `RegressionReport` fields for deterministic dummy inputs.
- Visualization helpers: asserts `scatter_plot`, `residual_plot`, and `save_fig` return figures and persist files to disk.

## Known Gaps

- No coverage yet for `core.features` or `core.logging`.
- Dataset fixtures rely on existing CSVs; corruption handling and negative cases are not validated.
- Visualisation tests exercise basic calls only; style/theme configuration remains untested.

## Suggested Follow-Ups

1. Extend smoke tests to cover preprocessing pipelines once `core.features` is implemented.
2. Add failure-path tests for dataset loaders (missing files, invalid test size) when error handling stabilises.
3. Introduce marker strategy (`slow`, `ssl`) to segregate heavier SSL and notebook-driven tests in future tickets.
