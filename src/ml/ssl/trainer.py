"""Training utilities for masked autoencoder workflows.

This module will orchestrate the self-supervised training loop, including noise injection,
optimization, and checkpointing.

Todo:
    * Implement PyTorch training steps with gradient accumulation support.
    * Add hooks for logging losses and hyperparameters to docs/trace.
    * Provide checkpoint save/load helpers for experiment continuity.
