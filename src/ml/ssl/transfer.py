"""Transfer learning utilities bridging SSL backbones and Auto MPG regression heads.

This module will encapsulate fine-tuning routines that adapt masked autoencoder
representations for supervised mpg prediction.

Todo:
    * Implement lightweight regression heads and optimization strategies.
    * Provide evaluation hooks for comparing against supervised baselines.
    * Integrate with trainer utilities for consistent logging.
