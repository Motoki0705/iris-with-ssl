This module will define random and structured mask generators to support the masked
autoencoder training pipeline.

Todo:
    * Implement configurable masking policies and distributions.
    * Provide utilities for reproducible mask sampling per batch.
    * Integrate diagnostics for mask coverage and feature importance.
