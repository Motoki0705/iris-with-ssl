"""Masked autoencoder model definitions for the Auto MPG dataset.

This module will include encoder and decoder architectures built with PyTorch to reconstruct
masked tabular features.

Todo:
    * Define configurable encoder/decoder modules with positional embeddings.
    * Support different latent dimensionalities and activation choices.
    * Provide utilities for initializing weights and loading checkpoints.
