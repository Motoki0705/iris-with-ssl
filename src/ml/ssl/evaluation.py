This module will provide metric computation, comparison routines, and report generation
for SSL and downstream regression tasks.

Todo:
    * Implement reconstruction loss tracking and visualization hooks.
    * Add utilities for aggregating downstream regression metrics.
    * Export structured summaries into docs/results artifacts.
