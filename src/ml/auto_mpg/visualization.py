"""Visualization helpers for Auto MPG regression outputs.

This module will provide reusable routines for plotting regression curves, residuals, and
predicted versus observed comparisons.

Todo:
    * Implement figure factories for different model families.
    * Standardize styling and exporting into docs/results directories.
    * Integrate with logging utilities to annotate figures with metadata.
